====== Front Matter ======

===== About =====
''Front Matter'' is a dokuwiki plugin that:
  * permits to add dokuwiki metadata in a json format.
  * add metadata into the HTML page:
      * SEO
          * description
          * canonical
      * Twitter (todo)
      * Facebook (todo)

It borrows its name from the [[https://datacadamia.com/markup/front-matter|front matter book]]





===== Example =====
Just add a block of code that:
  * starts with ''%%---json%%''
  * contains a json document
  * end with ''%%---%%''

Example:
<code javascript>
---json
{
    "canonical":"my:id",
    "description":"That's the article that you want to read!"
}
---
</code>

===== Built-in Properties =====
''Front Matter'' takes into account the below properties
==== canonical ====
''canonical'' is an [[data:modeling:identifier|identifier]] for a dokuwiki page that will be used to define the [[web:html:canonical|canonical link]].

The ''canonical link'' identifies uniquely a page in a domain.

The ''canonical'' value:
  * should never change (theoretically)
  * does not need to be the [[doku>pagename]]

Example:
  * if the canonical value is ''cat:post1''
  * on a page hosted at ''example.com''
  * the canonical meta would be:
<code html>
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/cat/post1" />
</code>
==== description ====
''description'' is the [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML#Active_learning_The_descriptions_use_in_search_engines|meta description]].




<code html>
<meta name="description" content="The best page on the universe">
</code>
