====== Web Component - URL manager  ======



===== About =====
The 404 Manager plugin is a plugin that I have created to change the behavior of this website when a page:
  * doesn't exist 
  * of has been moved
  * of has been deleted

On a normal website, when a page doesn't exist, you get an [[wp>HTTP_404|hard HTTP 404 response]] as [[kb>http/status|HTTP Status]], hence the name of the plugin.

The plugin can:
  * redirect to the edit mode
  * redirect to a internal page
  * redirect to an external page
  * redirect to the search engine
  * show you the pages with the same name

===== More =====

  * The plugin is available for free here: See [[doku>plugin:404manager]]
  * More.... Specifications, Usage and Installation can be found on the [[github>gerardnico/dokuwiki-plugin-404manager|Readme file of the github repository]]

===== URL Processing =====

If a page does not exist
  * if the page has a [[:semantic:canonical|canonical]], rewrite the ID to the [[:semantic:canonical|canonical]] one
  * if the page has a redirect, redirect with a permanent redirection (301)
  * if the user has a write permission, redirect the action to edit
  * if the user has only read permission, follow the redirect actions in order of the configurations


===== Message =====
  * There is no message for a [[rewrite|rewrite]] by default.
