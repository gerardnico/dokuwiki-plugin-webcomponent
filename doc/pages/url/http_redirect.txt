====== HTTP Redirect ======





===== 302 vs 301 =====

[[https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7238431|URL move for Google]] Use 302 redirects, not 301 redirects 
```text
If you’re running an A/B test that redirects users from the original URL to a variation URL, 
use a 302 (temporary) redirect, not a 301 (permanent) redirect. 
This tells search engines that this redirect is temporary—it will only be in place as long as you’re running the experiment—and that they should keep the original URL in their index rather than replacing it with the target of the redirect (the test page). 
JavaScript-based redirects are also fine.
