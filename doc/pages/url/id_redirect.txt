====== URL Manager - ID Redirect ======


===== About =====
An ''ID redirect'' is when the [[doku>pagename|ID]] of the URL is set to another one.

It can happen in the following case:
  * If the URL has a [[semantic:canonical|canonial path]], the dokuwiki ID will be rewritten to the page id.
  * If the [[page_rules|rewrite rules]] lead to an existent page.

===== Example =====
The following URLs have the same [[doku>pagename|dokuwiki id]] ''namespace:name''
  * https://example.com/doku.php?id=namespace:name
  * https://example.com/namespace/name (if [[doku>rewrite|dokuwiki URL rewriting]] was set)


If the page does not exist and that this ''ID'' is a [[semantic:canonical|canonical value]] for the page ''othernamespace:name'', the ''ID'' will be rewritten (set) from:
  * ''namespace:name''
  * to ''othernamespace:name''

===== Message =====
A ''id redirect'' is transparent and shows no message.

===== Demo =====
This page has also a [[semantic:canonical|canonical value]] of  ''rewrite'' and is therefore accessible also from this URL [[:rewrite]]. The link is red because the file does not exist but you will get the same page.
