====== URL Manager - ID Redirect ======


===== About =====
An ''ID redirect'' is when the [[doku>pagename|ID]] of the URL is set to another one.

It can happen in the following case:
  * If the URL has a [[#canonical|canonial path]], the dokuwiki ID will be rewritten to the page id.
  * If the [[page_rules|page rules redirection]] lead to an existent page.

==== Canonical Demo ====

This page has also a [[semantic:canonical|canonical value]] of  ''id:redirect'' and is therefore accessible also from this link 
<btn class="btn-light">
[[id:redirect#canonical demo|A link to demonstrate an ID Redirect]]
</btn>
\\

<wrap tip>The link is red because the dokuwiki page does not exist but you will get redirected to this page.</wrap>


==== Canonical Processing ====

  * When a user is asking for the non-existent page with the [[doku>pagename|dokuwiki id]] value ''namespace:name'' via one of this URL:
      * https://example.com/doku.php?id=namespace:name
      * or https://example.com/namespace/name (if [[doku>rewrite|dokuwiki URL rewriting]] was set)
  * If the page has a [[semantic:canonical|canonical value]] of ''othernamespace:name'', the ''ID'' will be rewritten (set) from:
      * ''namespace:name''
      * to ''othernamespace:name''


===== Message =====
A ''id redirect'' is transparent and shows no message.
